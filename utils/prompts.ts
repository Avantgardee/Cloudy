WEATHER_CONTEXT

Suggest 2-3 music genres and a few specific artists or songs that would complement the current weather conditions.
Be creative with your suggestions and explain briefly why they match the weather mood.
Consider the time of day (day/night) and overall weather condition in your music recommendations.`;

Share an interesting and educational weather fact.

Current weather conditions:
WEATHER_CONTEXT

You can relate it to the current weather conditions or share a general fascinating weather phenomenon.
Make it engaging and informative, something that would surprise most people.
If the current conditions include any notable elements (high UV, precipitation, temperature extremes), consider 
prioritizing facts related to those conditions.`;

WEATHER_CONTEXT

Recommend 3-4 activities that would be enjoyable and practical in these conditions.
Include a brief explanation of why each activity would be good for this weather.
Consider time of day, UV index, precipitation probability, and temperature when making recommendations.
If the conditions aren't ideal for outdoor activities, suggest suitable alternatives.`;
